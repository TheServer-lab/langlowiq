# 🧠 LangLowIQ — The Stupidly Simple Programming Language

> *Because not every language has to be smart.*

LangLowIQ is a **lightweight, humorous scripting language** designed for fun and experimentation.  
It’s simple, forgiving, and intentionally not too smart — perfect for making silly scripts, random generators, or parody projects.

## 🤓 What It Does

LangLowIQ supports:
- **say**, **yell**, **whisper** — output text in different tones  
- **let**, **set**, **now**, **uhmath** — variable assignments and math  
- **mathlikeanidiot** — evaluate math expressions (poorly)  
- **random**, **maybe**, **wait**, **ragequit** — randomization, timing, and program exit
